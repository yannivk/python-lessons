# My Learning Progress

## Current Status
- Level: **Intermediate Beginner** (strong fundamentals, progressing well)
- Last completed: Day1_Cell_Data.ipynb (January 2025) - Excellent work!
- Next recommended: exercises/Week1_Cellular_Foundations/Day2_DNA_Strings.ipynb

## Strengths
- **String manipulation**: Excellent work with DNA sequence analysis - used .count(), string concatenation, dictionary comprehension
- **Lists and iteration**: Strong understanding of list operations, max/min functions, list comprehensions
- **Functions**: Good grasp of function definition and basic usage
- **Mathematical operations**: Comfortable with calculations and numpy integration
- **Problem-solving approach**: Methodical, logical thinking through multi-step problems
- **Library usage**: Already familiar with numpy and pandas basics

## Areas for Improvement
- **Conditional logic**: Used bitwise operators (&) instead of logical operators (and) in if statements
- **Dictionaries**: Started strong but didn't complete all dictionary tasks (stopped after problem 1)
- **Classes/OOP**: No prior experience - needs introduction to object-oriented concepts
- **Code optimization**: Some unnecessary complexity (e.g., int() casting for already-integer values)
- **Error handling**: Could benefit from understanding edge cases

## Completed Exercises
- Level_Assessment.ipynb (December 2024) - Shows solid fundamentals with specific areas to reinforce
- Day1_Cell_Data.ipynb (January 2025) - Strong work on variables, calculations, and conditional logic. Good use of string formatting.

## Session Notes
- Student prefers practical examples over heavy biological focus
- Wants to strengthen basic concepts before advancing
- Shows good analytical thinking and willingness to experiment
- Ready for structured progression from current level

## Learning Plan
**Immediate focus (next 2-3 exercises):**
1. Variables and conditional logic (fix and/or operators)
2. Dictionary manipulation and iteration
3. Function practice with real-world problems

**Week 1 goals:**
- Master conditional statements and logical operators
- Build confidence with dictionaries and nested data structures
- Reinforce good coding practices and naming conventions

**Future topics to introduce:**
- Object-oriented programming (classes) - introduce gradually
- Error handling and edge cases
- Code organization and best practices
