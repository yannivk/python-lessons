# My Learning Progress

## Current Status
- Level: **Intermediate Beginner** (strong fundamentals, progressing well)
- Last completed: Day2_DNA_Strings.ipynb (January 2025) - Excellent string manipulation work!
- Next recommended: exercises/Week1_Cellular_Foundations/Day3_Protein_Lists.ipynb

## Strengths
- **String manipulation**: Excellent work with string indexing, loops, and .count() method
- **Functions**: Strong function definition skills - good use of parameters and return values
- **Loops and iteration**: Proper use of range() and for loops with string indexing
- **Dictionary usage**: Smart use of .get() method with fallback values
- **Mathematical operations**: Comfortable with calculations and percentage computations
- **Problem-solving approach**: Methodical, logical thinking through multi-step problems
- **Code structure**: Clean, readable code with good variable names

## Areas for Improvement
- **Variable naming**: Could be more descriptive (e.g., "patient_dna" vs "patient")
- **Output formatting**: Could reduce verbose output and focus on key results
- **List operations**: Ready to learn list manipulation, sorting, and advanced operations
- **Classes/OOP**: No prior experience - needs introduction to object-oriented concepts
- **Error handling**: Could benefit from understanding edge cases

## Completed Exercises
- Level_Assessment.ipynb (December 2024) - Shows solid fundamentals with specific areas to reinforce
- Day1_Cell_Data.ipynb (January 2025) - Strong work on variables, calculations, and conditional logic. Good use of string formatting.
- Day2_DNA_Strings.ipynb (January 2025) - Excellent string manipulation, loops, and function creation. Mastered string indexing and dictionary lookups.

## Session Notes
- Student prefers coding focus over biological interpretation
- Wants exercises without biological questions/insights sections
- Shows good analytical thinking and willingness to experiment
- Ready for structured progression from current level
- Strong preference for pure programming practice

## Learning Plan
**Immediate focus (next 2-3 exercises):**
1. List operations and manipulation
2. List methods (append, sort, index, etc.)
3. Statistical functions with lists (max, min, sum)

**Week 1 goals:**
- Master list operations and data organization
- Build confidence with function creation and parameter passing
- Reinforce good coding practices and naming conventions

**Future topics to introduce:**
- Object-oriented programming (classes) - introduce gradually
- Error handling and edge cases
- Code organization and best practices
