# My Learning Progress

## Current Status
- Level: **Intermediate** (solid dictionary fundamentals, ready for advanced data structures)
- Last completed: Day1_Dictionaries.ipynb (January 2025) - Strong dictionary operations with room for refinement
- Next recommended: Day2_File_IO.ipynb - file reading/writing and data persistence

## Strengths
- **Dictionary operations**: Solid understanding of basic dict operations (create, access, update, methods)
- **Nested data structures**: Successfully navigated nested dictionaries with proper syntax
- **Loops and iteration**: Good use of dictionary iteration patterns (.items(), .keys(), .values())
- **List comprehensions**: Applied comprehension syntax to dictionary creation
- **Problem decomposition**: Broke complex problems into manageable steps
- **Data analysis**: Applied dictionary operations to practical data analysis scenarios
- **Code structure**: Generally clean, readable code with improving variable names

## Areas for Improvement
- **Logic errors**: Made several small mistakes (wrong variable in min/max operations, copying wrong values)
- **Safe dictionary access**: Needs practice with .get() method and error handling
- **Dictionary comprehensions**: Started well but needs more practice with complex transformations
- **Code verification**: Should double-check logic before running (several copy-paste errors)
- **Function completion**: Left incomplete functions and challenges unfinished
- **File I/O**: No experience with reading/writing files
- **Classes/OOP**: No prior experience - needs introduction to object-oriented concepts

## Completed Exercises
- Level_Assessment.ipynb (December 2024) - Shows solid fundamentals with specific areas to reinforce
- Day1_Cell_Data.ipynb (January 2025) - Strong work on variables, calculations, and conditional logic. Good use of string formatting.
- Day2_DNA_Strings.ipynb (January 2025) - Excellent string manipulation, loops, and function creation. Mastered string indexing and dictionary lookups.
- Day3_Protein_Lists.ipynb (January 2025) - Strong list operations, data analysis, and statistical calculations. Good use of list methods and nested data structures.
- Day1_Dictionaries.ipynb (January 2025) - Solid dictionary fundamentals with some logic errors. Successfully completed basic operations, nested dictionaries, and data analysis. Needs attention to detail and completion of advanced challenges.

## Session Notes
- Student prefers coding focus over biological interpretation
- Wants exercises without biological questions/insights sections
- Shows good analytical thinking and willingness to experiment
- Ready for structured progression from current level
- Strong preference for pure programming practice

## Learning Plan
**Week 2 focus:**
1. Dictionaries and advanced data structures
2. File I/O and data processing
3. Object-oriented programming basics (classes)

**Week 2 goals:**
- Master dictionary operations and nested data structures
- Learn file reading/writing and data persistence
- Introduction to classes and object-oriented concepts
- Reinforce good coding practices and error handling

**Future topics to introduce:**
- Advanced OOP concepts (inheritance, polymorphism)
- Error handling and exception management
- Code organization and modular programming
- Data analysis libraries (pandas, matplotlib)
