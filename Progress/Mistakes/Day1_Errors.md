## Mistakes Identified

### Error #1: Variable Naming
**Code Written:**
```python
x = 500000
y = 47000
```

**Issue:** Non-descriptive variable names
**Biological Context:** Like labeling cell samples as "Sample A" instead of "HeLa_cells_pre_treatment"
**Correction:**
```python
initial_cell_count = 500000
surviving_cells = 47000
```

**Biological Insight:** Clear naming is crucial in both lab notebooks and code
**Spaced Repetition:** Schedule variable naming practice in 1 day

---

### Error #2: Calculation Logic
**Code Written:**
```python
death_rate = surviving_cells / initial_cell_count * 100
```

**Issue:** Calculated survival rate instead of death rate
**Biological Context:** Confused the biological question - asking for cell death, not survival
**Correction:**
```python
cells_died = initial_cell_count - surviving_cells
death_rate = cells_died / initial_cell_count * 100
```

**Biological Insight:** Always verify calculations match the biological question
**Spaced Repetition:** Practice percentage calculations in 3 days

---

### Error #3: Data Type Confusion
**Code Written:**
```python
cell_type = HeLa
```

**Issue:** Missing quotes for string
**Biological Context:** Like writing chemical formulas without proper notation
**Correction:**
```python
cell_type = "HeLa"
```

**Biological Insight:** Text data needs quotes, numbers don't
**Spaced Repetition:** Review string syntax in 1 day
