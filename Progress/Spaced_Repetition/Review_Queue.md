# Spaced Repetition Review Queue ðŸ§ 
*Intelligent review system based on cognitive science and your learning patterns*

## How It Works
Your mistakes and successes automatically populate this queue using scientifically-optimized intervals:
- **1 Day:** Consolidation (retry with hints)
- **3 Days:** Interference resistance (new biological context)
- **1 Week:** Integration (combine with other concepts)
- **2 Weeks:** Flexibility (solve related biological problems)
- **1 Month:** Teaching (explain to reinforce mastery)

## Adaptive Scheduling

### High-Priority Concepts (Review Every 1-2 Days)
These showed persistent confusion or are foundational:
- [ ] String syntax and quotes
- [ ] Variable naming conventions
- [ ] Basic calculation logic

### Medium-Priority Concepts (Review Weekly)
These showed good understanding but need reinforcement:
- [ ] List operations and indexing
- [ ] Biological data interpretation
- [ ] Problem decomposition strategies

### Low-Priority Concepts (Review Monthly)
These showed strong mastery:

## Personalized Review Strategies

### Your Learning Profile Indicates:
- **Strength:** Biological intuition and problem breakdown
- **Challenge:** Syntax precision and careful reading
- **Style:** Learn best with concrete biological examples

### Optimized Review Methods:
1. **Biological First:** Always start with the biological context
2. **Incremental Practice:** Small, focused exercises rather than large problems
3. **Immediate Feedback:** Check syntax immediately, don't accumulate errors
4. **Connection Building:** Link new concepts to previous biological knowledge
