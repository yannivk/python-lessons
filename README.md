# PythonBioLab 🧬🐍
*Learn Python through biological problems and real research data*

## The Vision
Make Python learning engaging and relevant by solving real biological problems. Each exercise uses authentic research scenarios and datasets to teach programming concepts in a meaningful context.

## Learning Approach
- **Problem-Driven**: Start with interesting biological questions that require coding to solve
- **Real Data**: Work with actual research datasets and scenarios when possible
- **Guided Discovery**: Learn by doing with hints and feedback from Claude Code
- **Progressive Building**: Concepts build naturally from simple to complex
- **Flexible Focus**: Biological problems when they enhance learning, general programming when more appropriate

```

## Example Learning Journey
- **Day 1**: "How effective is this cancer drug?" → Learn variables and basic calculations
- **Day 2**: "What patterns exist in this DNA sequence?" → Master string manipulation  
- **Day 3**: "How do we organize protein family data?" → Understand lists and loops
- **Week 2**: "Can we predict enzyme function?" → Build functions and conditional logic

## Adaptive Learning
Claude Code tracks your progress and adapts the curriculum based on:
- Areas where you excel or struggle
- Your interests in biological vs. general programming topics
- Your preferred pace and learning style
- Concepts that need reinforcement

## Getting Started
1. **Assessment**: Run `assessment/Level_Assessment.ipynb` to establish your baseline
2. **First Exercise**: Start with your recommended exercise based on the assessment
3. **Learn by Doing**: Work through exercises with Claude Code's guidance
4. **Get Feedback**: Ask Claude Code to review your work and suggest next steps

## Working with Claude Code
- **Start a session**: "I'm ready to work on Python. What should we focus on today?"
- **Get help**: "I'm stuck on [specific problem]. Can you give me a hint?"
- **Review work**: "Can you check my solution and let me know what to improve?"
- **Adjust difficulty**: "This is too easy/hard. Can we adjust the level?"
