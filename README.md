# PythonBioLab 🧬🐍
*A 3Blue1Brown-inspired Python learning experience for biology and data science*

## The Vision
Transform Python learning from tedious exercises into biological discovery. Every concept connects to life sciences, every exercise solves real biological problems, and every mistake becomes targeted improvement through spaced repetition.

## Core Philosophy: Code Like a Biologist Thinks
- **Intuitive Building**: Start with biological intuition, then code the solution
- **Visual Learning**: Rich plots and interactive visualizations in every notebook
- **Generative Focus**: You write code, I guide and correct
- **Layered Understanding**: Concepts build like biological complexity
- **Real Problems**: No toy examples - solve actual biological mysteries

## Daily Lab Experience
Each day presents a **biological mystery** requiring code:

**Example Journey:**
- **Day 1**: "Why do some cells survive chemotherapy?" → Learn variables/data types
- **Day 5**: "How do enzymes choose substrates?" → Master functions  
- **Day 12**: "What drives bacterial evolution?" → Build classes and loops
- **Day 20**: "Can we predict protein structure?" → Apply machine learning

## Spaced Repetition Engine
Your mistakes drive tomorrow's focus:
- **Immediate**: Fix errors with guided hints
- **1 Day**: Retry similar problems  
- **3 Days**: Apply concept in new biological context
- **1 Week**: Integrate with more complex scenarios
- **1 Month**: Teach the concept by explaining code

## Getting Started
1. Run `Level_Assessment.ipynb` to establish baseline
2. Open your first Daily Lab notebook
3. Code solutions to biological problems
4. Let me review and guide improvements
5. Watch your Mastery Map evolve
