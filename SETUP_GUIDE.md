# Setup Guide for PythonBioLab

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+ installed
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Basic familiarity with running notebooks

### Getting Started
1. **Take the Assessment**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook assessment/Level_Assessment.ipynb
   ```
   Work through the problems to establish your baseline skills.

2. **Get Your Learning Plan**
   After completing the assessment, ask Claude Code:
   ```
   "Claude, please review my Level_Assessment.ipynb and recommend my first exercise"
   ```

3. **Start Learning**
   Begin with your recommended exercise in the `exercises/` directory.

### Daily Workflow
1. **Open the recommended notebook** for your current level
2. **Work through exercises** at your own pace
3. **Ask for help** when stuck: "Claude, I'm having trouble with [specific problem]"
4. **Get feedback** when done: "Claude, please review my work"
5. **Move to next exercise** based on Claude's recommendations

### Tips for Success
- Don't worry about making mistakes - they help Claude adapt your curriculum
- Ask questions about both the programming concepts and biological context
- Take your time to understand each concept before moving on
- Save your completed notebooks for future reference

### Getting Help
- **Stuck on a problem**: "Claude, can you give me a hint about [specific issue]?"
- **Need explanation**: "Claude, I don't understand [concept]. Can you explain it differently?"
- **Want to adjust pace**: "This is too easy/hard. Can we adjust the difficulty?"
- **Ready for next step**: "I finished [exercise]. What should I work on next?"

That's it! The system is designed to be simple - Claude Code handles all the complexity of tracking progress and adapting the curriculum to your needs.
